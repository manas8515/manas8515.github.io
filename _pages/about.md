I am an incoming graduate student at the University of Cambridge. I have a great interest in exploring the theoretical aspects of high-energy physics. At present, I am working on expanding my knowledge of abstract mathematical structures and understanding how they are weaved together in the formulation of all of physical theories manifested in nature.

A deep dive into the ocean shall unravel the rest of the iceberg clearing the path for our ships to sail through.
